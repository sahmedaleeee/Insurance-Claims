This interactive Insurance Claims Performance Dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of claim data across various regions and states, enabling stakeholders to assess and compare performance on critical metrics such as total claims, average claim amounts, loss ratio, days to settle claims, retention rate, and satisfaction score.

### Purpose

The primary purpose of this dashboard is to deliver actionable insights by comparing regional and state-level performance against set targets. It helps insurance companies and analysts identify trends, spot areas needing improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance overall service quality and operational efficiency.

### Key Features

1. **Comparative Performance Analysis:**
   - **Metrics Monitored:** The dashboard evaluates total claims, average claim amounts, loss ratio, days to settle claims, retention rate, and satisfaction score.
   - **Regional vs. State-Level Performance:** Compare these metrics at both regional and state levels, highlighting how each state performs against its regional and national targets.
   - **Target Comparison:** Metrics are benchmarked against predefined targets at the state level, providing clear visual indicators of areas that are meeting or missing targets.

2. **Yearly Trends Analysis:**
   - **Regional Level Trends:** Displays yearly trends in claims and claim amounts by region, enabling a historical view of performance fluctuations over time. This allows stakeholders to pinpoint years of significant improvement or decline.

3. **Detailed State-Level Analysis:**
   - The second page of the dashboard delves deeper into state-specific performance, comparing each stateâ€™s metrics to other states within the same region or across the nation. This granular view facilitates more precise performance evaluations and targeted action plans.

### Benefits

- **Performance Benchmarking:** Provides a clear comparison of how states and regions stack up against targets, fostering accountability and driving improvements.
- **Data-Driven Decision Making:** Supports strategic planning by revealing patterns in claims handling and customer satisfaction.
- **Operational Insights:** Helps identify bottlenecks in claims processing and areas where service levels can be enhanced.
